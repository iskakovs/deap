# Genetic Algorithms with DEAP in Python

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating the implementation and application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) using Python and the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) package. Genetic Algorithms are a powerful optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. These projects showcase how GAs can be used to solve complex optimization problems in various domains.

## Requirements
